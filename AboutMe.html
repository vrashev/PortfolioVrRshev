			<p><span> Philosophers believed that there are connections between individual human life and large collective events and processes.</span>  There was an intellectual framework for analyzing and interpreting meaningful human expressions, such as poetry, actions, thoughts, and motives. These frameworks were extended later on during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by Hermeneutics philosophers to understand large historical events and processes in similar terms. To understand History, we need to understand events, movements, and techniques in the same way we look at art and all created in a specific historical era. All events, individuals, and as a whole in human History are connected. </p>
	<p><span>I am interested in History since I was little.</span>  History influenced art and vice versa. Art is used in many ways to understand History; through artworks, historians today develop more in-depth knowledge of the past, what makes those people create, what bothered and amused them, and kept them up late at night? </p>
			<p><span>I try to explore the future so I would be able to understand the past</span> I learn from the past so that I can have a brighter future. 
I am learning multiple languages: English, Spanish, HTML, CSS, Java, P5, Processing, French, and Italian. To learn a language is the path to understand the culture of a given nation. To understand America, this is my goal. I explore contextual historically embedded pain and suffering, love and happiness, dreams and hopes. 
I try to expand my knowledge with programs such as Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco.
I am learning and improving every day, learning to draw digitally, code, and participate in zoom meetings. At the same time, do not lose connection with the real world. 
The Digital World full of wonders that I happily dive into; it is still magic even if you know how it is done. Enjoy my magic. </p>
