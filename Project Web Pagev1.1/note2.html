				<p><b>1. As you get better, the game gets bigger.</b></p>
				<p>When we succeed at a little game, we get to play in a bigger game...and a bigger game. When we start school, we begin in Grade One. Next is Grade Two, Three and so on. Life is a gradual progression.</p>

				<p><b>2. One thing leads to another.</b></p>
				<p>"What are you doing with what you have?" Start anywhere you can. Give your best short to whatever is in front of you, and opportunity will begin to find you. It's called <b>"One thing leads to another"</b></p>
			</li>

				<p><b> 3. Discipline.</b></p>
				<p>Have the discipline to do little things you don't like, and you can spend your life doing the big things you do like. Self-discipline in the little things-studying instead of TV/Gaming- leads to a big thing- better qualifications.</p>
			</li>

				<p><b>4. Order.</b></p>
				<p> The first law pf expansion is "order". For something to grow, it needs a system.Wherever performance counts, there is a organisation. Nothing blooms out of mess. "As within, so without"- your enviroment reflects your thinking. Usually when your house is a mess, so is your life.</p>

				<p><b>Be Adaptable!</b></p>
				<p> We live in a world where things are always changing. World changes, even the experts can get it wrong. (The COVID19 pandemic) What is true today maynnot be true tomorrow.The only constant we have is <b>change</b>. Successful people don't just accept change, they embrace it.<b>"Why would I want my next five years to be like my last five?"</b></p>
