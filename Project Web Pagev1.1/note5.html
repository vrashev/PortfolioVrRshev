				<p><b>1. The Present moment.</b></p>
				<p>All you have is <b>NOW</b>. Regardless of what happened yesterday and what might happen tomorrw, <b>NOW</b> is where you are. Make something of this moment.How often do we put ourselves through hell, contemplating what might happen? yet, if we look at the present moment, which is all we have, there is no great problem at all.</p>

				<p><b>2. Forgiveness.</b></p>
				<p>The decision to forgive yourself or somebody else is a vote to live in the present moment. To forgive someone else is letting go of the past. Forgivness is a step away from guilt trip that is putting us into extra mental anguish.The moment we chose to change the way we see things, others respond to our changed expectations.</p>

				<p><b> 3. Perfection and Happiness.</b></p>
				<p>The world is not "perfect". Our unhappiness is equal to the distance between the way things are and the way "ought"to be. As we become more flexible, being happy becomes easier. We then choose to see the hings might be, and decide that if something goes wrong, we will be happy anyway.</p>
			</li>

				<p><b>4. Depression.</b></p>
				<p> Every one goes through times when life seems extrenely difficult! One take himself/herself too seriosly! The whole world is wathcing. It is not. And so if it is? No doubt one is living the best life the best way one knows how. When it is hard bite off one small chunk at a time. Give yourself a five minute job into which you can put all your energy. We feel so much better when we are busy. Disasters aren't so disastrous if we tackle them a piece at a time. The sooner we recognize what we stand to gain from the experience, the easier it is to deal with.</p>
