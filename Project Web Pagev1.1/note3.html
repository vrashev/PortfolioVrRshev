				<p><b>1. Beliefs.</b></p>
				<p>When people argue for their limitations they say "I can't do "X" because...".The common excuse is "It's just the way I AM". More likely the truth is:"It's just the way I THINK I AM".</p>

				<p><b>2. But I know I'm right!</b></p>
				<p>We all believe something slightly different about the world -and we all know that what we believ is right. Why? Because we are right!Changing beliefs is hard. Most of us would rather be right than happy.</p>
			</li>

				<p><b> 3. Labels.</b></p>
				<p>Most of us have a "story". We label ourselves..."teacher","new age guy", "housewife". Our story is like a software program, lodged between our ears and controling our lifes. It's our personal marketing package. We spent our lives trying to fit the story. We buy our cars and clothes, and choose our friends to fit the story.</p>
			</li>

				<p><b>4. You are not your Story.</b></p>
				<p> You don't belong in a category or a box. You are human being having a series of experiences. When you quit dragging a story around, you never have to "look the part". Ask yourself "What would I do if I had no story?"</p>
